# Hospital Readmissions Analysis: Explainable AI for Tree Models and Neural Networks

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing hospital readmissions using machine learning models, including tree-based models and neural networks. It emphasizes the use of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand model predictions and uncover actionable insights. The project aims to:

- Identify key factors influencing hospital readmissions.
- Develop interpretable predictive models.
- Highlight the importance of data quality over complex model structures.

All workflows, findings, and explanations are consolidated into a single Jupyter Notebook for simplicity and clarity.
